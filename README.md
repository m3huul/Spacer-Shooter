"Space Shooter" was my first Unity project, created with the aim of learning Unity and Unity C# basics. It is a 2D game where players control a ship using the WASD keys and can fire bullets using the spacebar. The objective is to survive against enemy ships that spawn randomly from the right side of the screen and shoot single bullets at the player.

This project helped me understand fundamental game mechanics, such as player movement, shooting mechanics, enemy spawning, and projectile behavior within Unity.
