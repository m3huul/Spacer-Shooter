"Space Shooter" is a beginner Unity project aimed at learning fundamental concepts within the Unity engine. It is a 2D game where players control a ship using the WASD keys and can fire bullets using the spacebar. The objective is to survive against enemy ships that spawn randomly from the right side of the screen and shoot single bullets at the player. This project focuses on understanding basic game mechanics, such as player movement, shooting mechanics, enemy spawning, and projectile behavior within Unity.
